1. Objectives
* Become familiar with the navigating JavaScript JSON objects;
* Use of JSON.parse parser and synchronous XMLHttpRequest;
* Transform the content of a JSON document into an HTML page.
  
2. Description
You are required to write an HTML/JavaScript program, which takes the URL of a JSON document containing Trucking companies information, parses the JSON file, and extracts the list of trucking companies, displaying them in a table. The JavaScript program will be embedded in an HTML file so that it can be executed within a browser.
* Your program should display a text box to enter the JSON file name as shown below in Figure 1. On clicking the “Submit Query” button, your program should display the table as shown below, Figure 2. If the text box is left empty and Submit Query is clicked, an appropriate error message must be shown.
* Once the JSON file is downloaded, a JavaScript function within the HTML file parses the JSON document that was passed as an input in the edit box.
• After parsing the JSON document, a popup window or tab shpuld display a table consisting of the data for all trucking companies that are contained in the JSON file.
